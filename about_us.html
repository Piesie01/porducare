                    <h3>We Empower, Educate and Inspire.</h3>
                    <p>
                        Porducare Enterprise is a social enterprise that is dedicated to the
                        production and branding of quality shea butter to provide a ready
                        market for local shea butter producers, create employment
                        opportunities for the youth, empower women economically, and 
                        protect the shea trees. The Shea industry is a major source of 
                        livelihood for over two million households in Northern Ghana and 
                        has the potential of alleviating poverty and creating sustainable 
                        jobs. Despite the huge market size, local Shea producers do not get
                        their rightful share as a result of low quality and poor packaging.
                        In effect, local shea producers in northern Ghana fell the Shea trees 
                        and burn them into charcoal. Others move to urban cities to seek 
                        non-existing greener pastures. <br><br> This is because they see no value in 
                        the Shea trees since they are not making their rightful ends means 
                        from them. We facilitate the formation of women groups and build 
                        their capacities on product quality to ensure they produce quality 
                        shea butter in larger quantities to meet the market demand. We source
                        raw Shea nuts directly from these groups at premium prices and also 
                        refine some of the organic Shea butter into shea pomade, lotion, and 
                        other shea products. <br><br> Porducare Enterprise is making a difference in 
                        agribusiness by producing, branding, and marketing high-quality shea 
                        butter from shea nuts gathered in the wild by rural women in Northern
                        Ghana. Through this, shea nut pickers have gained access to higher-end
                        markets and a larger share of the value from nuts picked. Our 
                        solution has increased the sales revenue of local shea butter 
                        producers making it possible to reduce the burning/cutting of shea 
                        trees and has prevented many from moving from Northern Ghana to seek 
                        for non-existing greener pastures.  As a social enterprise, part of 
                        our profit is used to purchase sanitary towels and educational 
                        materials for the less privileged. <br><br>
                        Currently, we refine some of the raw shea butter into pomade, 
                        lotion, and other natural products with natural essential oils 
                        and fragrances to reduce the rate at which people get skin 
                        diseases as a result of using pomades/creams with harmful 
                        chemicals.

                    <h3>About the CEO; Dumba Portia</h3>
                    <p>
                        Dumba Portia, the CEO of this social enterprise is a young entrepreneur
                        who has the plight of women and young girls at heart. She hails from the 
                        Upper West Region of Ghana. She is a youth leader, mentor to young girls,
                        an advocate for women empowerment, and an environmental protection advocate.
                        Portia is a teacher by profession currently working in the Sawla Tuna Kalba
                        District in the Savannah Region of Ghana. <br>
                        Having risen from a humble family, Portia is compassionate, tolerant,
                        kind-hearted, and a team player. This translates into her efforts in 
                        helping learners at her school with cloths, teaching and learning 
                        resources as well as training young ladies and women in rural areas to
                        add value to shea butter for sale. <br><br>

                        Portia is well-presented, self-motivated and focused young lady with passion for 
                        youth development. Her contribution to youth participation and development is 
                        quite enormous as a staunch advocate for youth, girls and young women rights and 
                        empowerment in the Upper West Region.
                        Her strong demonstration of leadership further earned her the Community Aid for Rural 
                        Development (CARD-GHANA) recognition as they named her among their SHELEADS project model- 
                        one of their ongoing projects in the Region promoting girls and young women leadership and 
                        inclusion in decision making spaces. <br><br>

                        This new recognition has further provided her platform to engage frequently with more youths, 
                        adults and children to better understand their plights and concerns and also join in finding 
                        concrete solutions to those issues during the organisation's outreaches in the Upper West Region. <br><br>
                        Dumba Portia, together with her team is focused on adding value to shea Butter
                        for sale whilst touching lives in Northern Ghana through impactful social 
                        interventions. <br><br>
