                    We buy the shea butter for further distribution or processing
                    into creams and body lotions. We also link them to other 
                    businesses that use shea butter as raw materials as a means of helping 
                    them reach a larger market. <br>
                    This enables them to earn a descent living as well as reduce

            </h3>
            <div class="product_desc">
                <p> With the increasing cases of men taking advantage
                    of young ladies in rural areas due to thier (the
                    ladies') inability to provide basic needs for
                    themselves, Porducare Enterprise has decided to help
                    curb the situation by organizing skills training workshops for women
                    and young girls in Northern Rural Areas. Among other skills
                    taught are liquid soap making and how to add value to shea
                    butter for sale. <br> This is also geared towards making these
                    young ladies and women economically engaged as well as
                    financially independent. This prevents them from engaging in social 
                    vices that may be caused by idleness.

            <h3>We help Donate Sanitory Pads to Girls in School.
            </h3>
            <div class="product_desc">
                <p> The galloping increase in price of sanitory pads in recent months
                    has made it difficult for young girls at school going age to afford them.
                    In light of this, Porducare Enterprise works hand in hand with
                    benevolent individuals in the society to help
                    donate sanitary pads to young girls in some rural
                    communities in Northern Ghana. Most of these ladies
                    tend to drop out of school in an attempt to escape 
                    stigmatization from their peers. The cost of these
                    sanitory pads also makes these young girls vulnerable
                    as men tend to take advantage on them before helping them
                    purchase these sanitory pads. This regular intervention in fueld by our desire
                    to empower women as well as help young girls in rural areas
                    live decent lives.

            <h3>We Donate Footware and Learning Materials to Learners
                in Rural communities.
            </h3>
            <div class="product_desc">
                <p> One of the main challenges teachers in rural communities face is lack 
                    teaching and learning resources. Most of learners in these communities 
                    go to school without books and writing materials or if lucky, with one 
                    book for all the subjects. <br>
                    We regularly donate footware and learning materials such as
                    pencils and exercise books; through the support of
                    individuals and other organizations to help keep these children
                    from financially challeged homes in school. We do this to
                    motivate and inspire these learners to attend school regularly.
                    Since most families in the rural areas struggle to provide 
                    three-square meal daily, their challenge in providing books
                    and other learning materials for their children is considerably
                    understandable; hence the intervention.

            </h3>
            <div class="product_desc">
                <p> At regular intervals, we organize girl-child empowerment
                    sessions for girls in school. Since most girls within the adolescent ages
                    are inquisitive to try what others do for personal experiences, it is 
                    eminent we guide them from peer inflence. It also prudent that these young 
                    girls who have decided against the status quo in rural communities to stay in
                    school be given regular encouragement and assistance on their journey to 
                    being responsible adults. <br>This is to motivate and
                    inspire them to aspire to be great women and women of value
                    in the society. Among other topics that are discussed include
                    career paths, responsible parenting, the role of women in 
                    nation building among other topics which will arm the young girls
                    to aspire to be responsible adults in future.

            </h3>
            <div class="product_desc">
                <p> Teaching and learning becomes fun and effective if all learners are in decent 
                    attires or uniforms. It makes learners look smart and presentable as well as 
                    prevent stigmatization from the few who are descent. Although that is their parents' 
                    reponsibilty, these parents or relatives can not be blammed entirely 
                    since a three-square meal daily is a challenge in these communities. <br>
                    To help bridge the gab, we also engage in a once a while patching of uniforms 
                    exercise for learners in rural communities in the Sawla Tuna
                    Kalba district. This is done to ensure that learners
                    appear neat and presentable in school to study. This
                    activity is mostly carried out together with some 
                    liked minded entreprenuers who also have vested interest 
                    in helping learners in rural areas.

                <p> Due to human activities such as mining, farming, sand wining, burning of charcoal, among 
                    others, millions of trees have been cut down to pave way for the afforementioned activities. This has 
                    resulted in global warming and climate change in most parts of the world including Ghana.
                    It is also worth noting that, women in the northern Ghana cut down shea trees to burn 
                    charchoal, sell in order to support their families. This is a desturbing situation but efforts 
                    have been made to curb the situation. <br>
                    As we train these women to acquire profitable skills, we also admonish them to protect their 
                    business by protecting the shea trees.
                    In addition to that, engage in tree plantation.

            <p>For a long time, I had a challenge with finding the perfect skin care product
                for my skin. When I was introduced to Porducare Shea Butter pomade, I was a 
                bit skeptical but when I finally tried it on my skin for a week, it made my 
                skin smooth and moisturized. I love it.

                    <p>
                        Porducare Enterprise is a social enterprise that is dedicated to the
                        production and branding of quality shea butter to provide a ready
                        market for local shea butter producers, create employment
                        opportunities for the youth, empower women economically, and 
                        protect the shea trees. The shea industry is a major source of 
                        livelihood for over two million households in Northern Ghana and 
                        has the potential of alleviating poverty and creating sustainable 
                        jobs. Despite the huge market size, local shea producers do not get
                        their rightful share as a result of low quality and poor packaging.
                        In effect, local shea producers in northern Ghana fell the Shea trees 
                        and burn them into charcoal. Others move to urban cities to seek 
                        non-existing greener pastures.
